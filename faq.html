What is the solution that you are bringing?</h3><p>Up-Ride addresses the inconvenience of gym and outdoor exercise options due to time constraints or weather. Up-Ride represents a major improvement in price/quality trade-off for low impact cardio fitness equipment. Secondary benefits include being multimodal (stationary bicycle or stationary elliptical). High level build quality (tight tolerance construction and durable bearings) and industry leading adjustability. Ability to easily store and transport your elliptical exercise machine. Up-Ride provides this high quality experience through the unique approach of being a bicycle accessory conversion.  We leverage the bike you have to reduce material costs while retaining the same bearings and tight tolerance construction as a gym machine.</p><h3>What is your market and what is the size of this market?</h3><p>Elliptical exercise is the most popular low impact fitness equipment solution. The US market for ellipticals is about a billion dollars and growing. The global market is difficult to estimate in size (less available data) but likely at least double the US market. The beachhead market for Up-Ride is married suburban mom with kids and white collar middle aged men with a running injury. These are demographics that feel the pain/trade offs of the time and money crunch of modern life and the trade off in personal expenses and family spending. They are likely seeking out solutions for fitness already because of these limitations (time, money, physical pain) and are willing to be early adopters for this new take on elliptical.  There are different ways of sizing the market. The number of runners in the united states is around 20 million people with a somewhat even male female split. The majority of both men and women own a bicycle for some or most of their adult life (numbers vary). Fitness lifestyle disease becomes a permanent public issue. The addressable participation in the United States is trending upwards especially as market is really Up-Ride's ability to garner attention and communicate value to our future customers/users.  </p><h3>What is or will be the competitive advantage of your project? What makes it or will make it unique? How do you think your idea will change the life of people?</h3><p>Up-Ride brings a fundamentally new approach to providing stationary elliptical running to the consumer market. Our patent filing asserts domain over converting/incorporating a cycling apparatus into exercise equipment. This allows for future line expansions both in bicycling and the spin cycling markets. Bicycle to elliptical may be followed by bicycle to rowing machine or stepper. There is even a potential for home resistance training. Up-Ride as a platform provides versatility and flexibility for the user to get the exercise experience they want.  While providing convenience, flexibility, and versatility of exercise equipment may not be the end to world hunger or cheap energy they are essential components of a healthy lifestyle. People who exercise get enormous benefits to their health and well being. In a non stop world making things a little easier can be a big deal for someone struggling with obesity or stress.</p><h3>Who are your competitors (current and future)?</h3><p>Direct competition for elliptical machines includes Icon, Precore, and Lifefitness. These 3 companies control 2/3rds of the stationary elliptical market in the USA. There are also are other major brands.  There is also direct and indirect competition for health fitness dollars in general from other forms of sporting equipment and events.  These may be complementary expenditures. If Up-Ride ventures into the outdoor elliptical market (currently a small niche) products like Elliptigo or the Bionic Runner would be major competitors. These companies and those like them sell product at $1000 plus a unit and Up-Ride has the potential to be significantly lower expenditure for the consumer. Up-Ride sees these "competitors" in the elliptical market and in the general fitness market more as potential partners than as adversaries. A rising tide lifts all ships. Providing fitness can make people healthier and we don't see more health as a negative.  Up-Ride would prefer to engage with other companies and brands to help evolve the industry.</p><h3>What part of your business idea would you explore and build first? Why?</h3><p>Up-Ride has been focused on design and manufacturing excellence. So much of what Up-Ride is offering comes down to user experience. We feel that achieving the best design and build quality will yield the greatest market share in the long term. So much of our pricing and profit will come down to manufacturing and supply chain cost that having the back of the house in order will lead to our viability and vitality as a company. We are still optimizing design but are close to a consumer product we are proud of and that consumers will love. Any time you are doing something where people's safety is concerned you must be extra vigilant both in terms of regulatory compliance and the reputation of your name. It is for all of these reasons that building prototypes has been our primary business activity followed by legal filings.</p><h3>How much time, money and other resources do you think you need in order to build a prototype / a minimum viable product that can be tested with potential customers?</h3><p>This is a very challenging question. There are quotes for design and manufacturing optimization which are around $15,000. The timeframe could be as short as 2-3 months for the design work, new prototype build, user testing, and crowdfunding video. The current strategy is to bootstrap this cost then do a crowdfunding raise of $45,000-$90,000 (150-300 units at $300 retail). The goal being to create enough positive cash flow to scale organically. In general a lot of the cost comes from what scale of production is desired. Large scale production requires more tooling and other upfront costs (lowering unit cost).  For large scale production costs could be as high as a $250,000-$500,000. There is ambiguity over cost of customer acquisition and the true scale of the desire for this kind of product.  Therefore marketing costs are a unknown at this time. Several strategies will be employed to gauge customer interest but until the product is more finalized / ready for user testing speculation would be premature.</p><h3>What KPIs and what revenue are you aiming for in two years?</h3><p>Units sold, margin/ cost of goods, error rate / unit tolerances, user engagement with product ( indicator under development), user engagement with brand (website and email metrics), web traffic to web sales (conversion rate)- this is important because this channel likely has the lowest cost of distribution. In terms of revenue projections while we enjoy the wild speculation of great wealth and despair at the possibility of poor reception by the general public we feel that without sales and without the ability to track month over month how effective our strategies are we would be exercising our imaginations more than our reason in speculating. We have generated formal projections if you do desire such a document modeled on different levels of product adoption and costs.</p><h3>What team have you gathered or will you gather for this project?</h3><p>Joseph Prosnitz as president- works full time on this endeavor. The legal counsel on matters of intellectual property of Brent Whitlock of Drinker Biddle & Reath - pro bono through a provision of The America Invents Act. The legal counsel of Julian Dibbell and the support of the legal firm Mayer Brown on business matters and trade- pro bono through Lawyers for the Creative Arts. Manufacturing Advisor Mark O'Brien a manufacturing engineer who chairs the Chicago chapter of Society of Manufacturing Engineers and has his own consultancy -pro bono through SCORE. Two teams of engineers have worked on the initial analysis and proof of concept models: Doug Hoang mechanical engineer did the initial modeling. He moved on to be in the current Y combinator startup class focusing on embedded electromechanical sensors for exercise. Innovalab consultancy comprised of the former in house long term prototype builders for Rehab Institute of Chicago did the proof of concept model. Current quote under consideration for manufacturing and user experience design is by former SRAM (2nd largest bicycle components maker) project lead. A number of other additional advisors and contractors are aiding the Up-Ride project. A marketing advisor is sorely needed. Several students are also doing different components of the Up-Ride work.</p><p>Upgrade your life with Up-Ride the bicycle to elliptical conversion kit!</p></div></div></div></div></div></body>
